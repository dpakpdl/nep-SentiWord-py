SentiWordNet Nepali
===================

SentiWordNet is available for english, it helps to analyze english language sentiment analysis.
SentiWordNet english available at: http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/

Alike SentiWordNet english this program generates SentiWordNet for nepali language and uses it to nepali language semtiment analysis.

# Tools used:
* python
* MySQL
* Shell

Sorry of inconvinence but due to copyright in used data I cannot provide the actual raw data.

If you need the SentiWordNet for nepali language feel free to mail me with the purpose at wannamit@gmail.com with subject SentiWordNetNep.

UPDATE
===============

I complied the nepali sentiwordnet during my undergrad studies. My HDD of that time crashed and lost all compiled data, this code is what remains. I can help if anyone needs assistancec or direction of method I used to generate sentiword but my version is now lost (sadface). It would put a smile in my face if anyone picks up this project, shares his/her idea and develops any model of SentiWordNetNep for public use.
